                Hello, my name is Ben(ton) Bergstrom. I'm a neuroqueer from the Denver area who
                enjoys 3 things in life: Games, Friends, and Food. I also have an extensive tattoo collection,
                with me working on multiple projects, such as my anime leg sleeve done by my cousin, the wonderful
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andersglossinger/?hl=en">Anders</a>. I'm also passionate
                about religious research, more specifically the extremeism behind memes. I've also been told I look a lot like Ed King
                (the guitarist from Lynnard Skynnard). 
            </p>
            <h2>Programming and Schooling</h2>
            <p id="paragraph2">
                When I'm not gaming or chilling, I'm programming. Programming has been a huge part of my life,
                from an early age I've programmed and am very passionate about my ability to do so. I'm also 
                a huge proponent in early education with technology, specifically programming, as that's how I started. 
                Before doing Flatiron, I was a student at the University of Denver, and before that, a student at Humanex Academy,
                a school for the neurodiverse. I'm currently at a break from university, as a mixture of ODD and holes in my education
                made it nearly impossible for me to finish. However, that doesn't mean I've not learned plenty, or had any good experiences through university.
                I was the president of a club, apart of a fraternity, as well as an overachiver during my first 3 years of school.
